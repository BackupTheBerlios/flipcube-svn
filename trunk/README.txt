======== FlipCube =========

==== Dedication:

To the Creator of 3D space, of topology, and of light and vision. 
Thank you for making us creators, in your image.


==== How to build:

- Prerequisites:

Java SDK 1.4 (download from http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html)
Java 3D 1.3 (download from http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/3D/downloads/index.html)

Downloading the class docs for Java 3D is also recommended if you plan to do any development.
(http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/3D/forDevelopers/J3D_1_3_API/j3dapi/index.html)
There is also a tutorial at http://java.sun.com/developer/onlineTraining/java3d/,
but it may be out of date, so it is good to have the class docs too.

- Compiling:

An elegant build process (e.g. with Ant) is one of our todo's.
Fortunately, FlipCube is a simple program and not hard to compile by hand.
You should be able to just do
   javac *.java
assuming that your Java SDK is set up right.

Building for a screensaver version and/or a Java Web Start version are on our to-do list.


==== Running:

Make sure Java 3D is installed right, then run
   java FlipCube
