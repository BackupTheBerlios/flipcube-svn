* Have each Face load an Image.

* Have each Cubelet create Facelets.
  Link each Facelet to the correct Face (non-trivial).
  
* Make each Facelet display only its own portion, of the right picture.

* Complete the code for the transformation of each cubelet from
 the previous one, based on the current state. Test this
 with various states. I.e. finish FlipCube.getRotation().
 (Rename it to getTransform()?)

* put some of the code from Facelet into Face.
  E.g. image and image scale (2x2 v.s 2x4 facelets) are properties of Face.

x Will efficiency be better if my textures have dimensions that are
  a power of 2?  If so maybe I should scale my textures accordingly.
  I've done so, have put them in images/256. Need to access them.
