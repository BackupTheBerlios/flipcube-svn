    <h1>FlipCube</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A 3D screensaver built on Java3D that animates a folding and rotating "flip cube" whose faces are
adorned with the pictures of your choice.</p>
    <h2>Dedication</h2>
    <p>To the Creator of 3D space, of topology, and of light and vision. <br />
Thank you for making us creators, in your image.</p>
    <h2>How to build</h2>
    <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html">Java SDK 1.4</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/3D/downloads/index.html">Java 3D 1.3</a>
      </li>
      <li>Downloading the <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/3D/forDevelopers/J3D_1_3_API/j3dapi/index.html">class docs</a> for Java 3D is also recommended if you plan to do any development.</li>
      <li>There is also a <a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/onlineTraining/java3d/">Java3D tutorial</a>,
but it is out of date in some sections, so it is good to have the class docs too.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Compiling</h3>
    <p>An elegant build process (e.g. with Ant) is one of our todo's.
Fortunately, FlipCube is a simple program and not hard to compile by hand.
You should be able to just do</p>
    <pre>   javac *.java</pre>
    <p>assuming that your Java SDK is set up right.</p>
    <p>Building for a screensaver version and/or a Java Web Start version are on our to-do list.</p>
    <h2>How to run</h2>
    <p>Make sure Java 3D is installed right, then run</p>
    <pre>   java FlipCube</pre>
    <p>When we figure out how the screensaver version will work, we'll give instructions on how to run it too.
(We do have some ideas though.)</p>
